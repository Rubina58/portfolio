                    I used to draw when i was kid but haven't draw for a long period of time. During previous lockdown my sparked for drawing was rekindled. Drawimg gives me a sense of satisfaction, i can freely express myself in a canvas when i hold a pencil. Its a form of art and one day i will master it.
